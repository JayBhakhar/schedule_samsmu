**Schedule SamSMU**

The "schedule_samsmu" project is a backend scheduling application built using FastAPI and MongoDB. FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python, is used to handle the application's backend logic, while MongoDB, a NoSQL database, is utilized for storing and managing data. This combination provides a robust, high-performance, and scalable solution for scheduling tasks and events.
